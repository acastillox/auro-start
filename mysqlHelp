Entity - table
Default values (good practice)
Aggregate expressions (or functions) group data

1. from, joins (total working set)
2. where (constraints)
	Aliases in the SELECT part of the query are not accessible in most databases since they may include 
	expressions dependent on parts of the query that have not yet executed
3. group by
4. having
5. SELECT (query is finally computed)
6. DISTINCT
7. order by
8. limit, offset

CREATE TABLE 
			 TEMPORARY
			 
			 [TEMPORARY] -> "visible only within the current session"
			 
			 COPY/CLONIG
			 
			 new [LIKE] original -> "create empty table based on the definition of other"
			 [AS] <query_expression> -> CREATE TABLE new_tbl AS SELECT * FROM orig_tbl;
			 [IGNORE|REPLACE] -> how to handle rows that duplicate unique keys values
								 when copying a table using a "SELECT"
								 
			 DATA TYPES
			 (DAFAULT DOES NOT APPLY to: BLOB, TEXT, GEOMETRY, JSON)
			 (AUTO-INCREMENT ONLY APPLY to: integer and floating types)
			 (CHARSET and COLLATE )

_ underscore (LIKE, NOT LIKE)
Apache Lucene or Sphinx???


columns being the properties and the rows being instances of the entity in the table
database schema is what describes the structure of each table
mathematical and string expressions

sqlite (does not support drop columns)

(DROP TABLE) Will have to either update all dependent tables first to remove the dependent rows or 
to remove those tables entirely
